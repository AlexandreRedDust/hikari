Hikari
======

Hikari is a Mega Man/Rockman game clone. It's written in C++. The goal of this 
project is to create a faithful clone of the classic NES title we know and love.

Dependencies

Hikari makes use of these other libraries:

* [Game_Music_Emu](http://slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html#Game_Music_Emu)
* [JsonCpp](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/)
* [Lua](http://www.lua.org/)
* [PhysicsFS](http://icculus.org/physfs/)
* [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org)

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
